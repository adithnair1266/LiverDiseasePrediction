# Machine Learning Model Comparison for Cirrhosis Disease Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook used to preprocess a dataset from Kaggle, train different machine learning models, and compare their accuracies. The research conducted using this notebook was presented at the 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Smart Energy (ICAIS 2024) and published in Springer journals.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this paper is the Cirrhosis Disease Dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Structure

- **Notebook**: The Jupyter notebook includes all steps for preprocessing the dataset and training various machine learning models.
- **Research Paper**: Detailed explanations and results of the experiment are documented in the research paper.
- **Dataset**: XLS File containing several features and target
- **Certificate**: Certificate recieved for the ICAIS Conference

## Preprocessing

Various preprocessing methods were applied to ensure the data is consistent and free from impurities. This includes:

- Handling missing values
- Normalizing and scaling data
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

## Models

Several machine learning models were trained and their accuracies compared, including but not limited to:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

## Results

The results of these experiments, along with detailed explanations, are documented in the research paper. The models were evaluated based on various performance metrics, and their accuracies were compared to determine the most effective model for predicting cirrhosis disease.
